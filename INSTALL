The Ireland Forest Disturbance from Earth Observation (IFordDEO) Python module

In order to run, you will need to have installed the following:

Python. I've specifically used the Continuum Analytics distributions (https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and utilised packages from conda-forge (there are some compilation issues with the standard conda Python compilations of GDAL), though you could also use ones that are available via pip or easy_install, assuming that you have proper compilation methods set up for your operating systems (Windows users: this is why I suggest using Anaconda or Miniconda). You will need the following packages for this to work:

1. numpy
2. numexpr (latest version, earlier versions had memory leak issues)
3. gdal

How to install them via conda? Simple:

> conda install -c conda-forge numpy numexpr gdal

Then hit yes for any additional packages needed.

You will also need the Irish Earth Observation (IEO) module (https://github.com/DrGuy/ieo), install via:

> python setup.py --install

This should set up imageprocess. Once successfully set up, install IForDEO via:

> python setup.py --install
